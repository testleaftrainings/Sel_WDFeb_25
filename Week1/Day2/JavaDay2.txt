Before JDK Installation:

+-------------------------------------------+
|               Machine State               |
|                                           |
|  +-------------------------------------+  |
|  |            Operating System         |  |
|  |                                     |  |
|  |  - No Java Development Tools        |  |
|  |  - No `java` or `javac` commands    |  |
|  |  - No JAVA_HOME environment var     |  |
|  |  - No JDK libraries or binaries     |  |
|  +-------------------------------------+  |
|                                           |
+-------------------------------------------+


Before installing the JDK, the machine lacks any Java development tools. There is no java or javac command available in the terminal, and the JAVA_HOME environment variable is not set. The system cannot compile or run Java programs.


After JDK Installation:

+-------------------------------------------+
|               Machine State               |
|                                           |
|  +-------------------------------------+  |
|  |            Operating System         |  |
|  |                                     |  |
|  |  - JDK Installed                    |  |
|  |  - `java` and `javac` commands      |  |
|  |  - JAVA_HOME environment var set    |  |
|  |  - JDK libraries and binaries added |  |
|  +-------------------------------------+  |
|                                           |

The Java Development Kit (JDK) includes several compilers and tools that are essential for Java development. Here are the main compilers and tools available in the JDK:

1)javac: This is the primary Java compiler included in the JDK. It compiles Java source code (.java files) into Java bytecode (.class files), which can then be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2)java: The Java application launcher. It is used to run Java applications by starting the JVM and executing the bytecode.

3)javadoc: This tool generates API documentation in HTML format from Java source code. It extracts comments and annotations from the source code to create comprehensive documentation.

4)jdb: The Java Debugger. It is a command-line tool that allows developers to debug Java applications by setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables.

5)jar: The Java Archive tool. It is used to create and manipulate JAR files, which are used to package Java classes and resources.

6)javac -h: This tool generates C header and source files from a Java class. It is used for writing native methods (methods implemented in languages like C or C++).

🌟 Java Data Types Made Easy! 🌟

In Java, primitive types like int have a fixed size and behavior. Unlike C/C++, where integer sizes can change depending on the system, Java keeps things consistent.
For example, an int is always 32 bits, no matter where you run it.

This strict rule ensures portability—your code works flawlessly on any device! 🚀 Sure, there might be a tiny performance trade-off, but the ability to run your program anywhere makes it totally worth it. 💻✨

Java = Write once, run everywhere! 🌍


-------------------------------------------------------------------

📱 Java Primitive Types Explained!  

Java’s primitive types (like int, char, boolean, etc.) are simple, single-value data types—not objects. Even though Java is fully object-oriented, these primitives are exceptions for the sake of efficiency.

Why? Because treating them as objects would slow things down! 🐢 By keeping them simple, Java ensures top-notch performance while still being a powerful object-oriented language. 💨

Think of primitives as the "speed boosters" of Java! 🚀


--------------------------------------------------------------------
📘 Java Integer Literals Made Easy!

🔢 Decimal (Base 10):
Normal numbers like 1, 42, 999.
⚠ No leading zeros! 09 → ❌ (invalid octal).

🎱 Octal (Base 8):
Start with 0 (zero). Digits: 0-7.
Example: 0123 → 83 in decimal.

🔵 Hexadecimal (Base 16):
Start with 0x or 0X. Digits: 0-9, A-F (case-insensitive).
Example: 0x1A → 26 in decimal.

💻 Binary (Base 2):
Start with 0b or 0B.
Example: 0b1010 → 10 in decimal.

🌈 Underscores for Readability (JDK7+):
Add _ in numbers to group digits!
✅ 123_456_789 → 123,456,789.
🚫 No _ at start/end: 123 or 123 → ❌.

📏 Types & Suffixes:

Default: int (32-bit).

Long? Add L/l at end: 123456789L.

byte/short allowed if value fits!

Access Modifier

1. public → A Government Census Report
Scenario: A published census report with population data that any citizen can read, share, or use.

Link to Java:

Like a public variable/method, the report is open to everyone (no restrictions).

2. private → A Biometric Safe
Scenario: A high-security safe that unlocks only with the owner’s fingerprint. Even family members can’t access it.

Link to Java:

Like a private variable, the safe’s contents are strictly restricted to the owner.

3. protected → A University Research Lab
Scenario: A lab where current students and alumni pursuing advanced degrees (e.g., PhDs) can access resources. Outsiders cannot enter.

Link to Java:

Like protected members, the lab grants access to current members (same class) and advanced successors (subclasses).

4. Default (Package-Private) → A Local Library Membership
Scenario: A library that allows only residents of the city to borrow books. Visitors from other towns are restricted.

Link to Java:

Like default access, the library is limited to a specific group (same package/residents).

Summary Table
Access Modifier			Real-World Example		Access Scope

public				Government Census Report	Everyone
private				Biometric Safe			Only the owner
protected			University Research Lab		Current members + Advanced successors
default				Local Library Membership	Same city residents only
