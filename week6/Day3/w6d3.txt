For Sequential Execution:
---------------------------
- Driver declaration should be static
- Create 2 testcases inside testcases package
     runLogin
     runCreateLead
- Select the required testcases and convert into testng.xml file
- Finally, run the testcases together sequentially from testng.xml file






For Parallel Execution:
-----------------------
    - Remove static keyword in BaseClass
    - Create parameterized constructor in each pages
       public LoginPage(ChromeDriver driver) {
        //this keyword-used in variable level
        this.driver- its coming from PSM or BaseClass
        driver- local variable
	        this.driver=driver;
         }
    - Pass driver value in each Constructor initialization in each pages and testcases
return new HomePage(driver);

//if static removed from driver -null pointer 
//i am having static keyword i cannot perform parallel

its possible  to run both seq and parallel





Cucumber with POM:
------------------
 - Create 4 packages
     - base
        Create BaseClass with common methods
        BaseClass should extend AbstractTestNGCucumberTests
     - features
         Create feature files
     - pages
        Create classes for each page and each page should extend BaseClass
     - runner
        Create CucumberRunner class and , mention glue="pages"
        The runner class should extend BaseClass



testxml -> threadcount
java--> Thread.sleep()
testNG attributes--> threadPoolsize


Thread :


The Thread class in Java is used for creating and managing threads, which enable concurrent execution of tasks. 

Why is one thread executing fully before the other?

1)Thread Scheduling is Non-Deterministic

The JVM assigns CPU time to threads based on the OS's thread scheduler.

Sometimes, the OS may allow Thread-0 to complete all its iterations before giving CPU time to Thread-1.

2)CPU Time Slice Allocation

Some OS schedulers may allocate longer time slices to a thread before switching to another.

This could cause one thread (Thread-0) to run completely before Thread-1 starts.

3)System Load and Thread Priority

If the system is lightly loaded, the OS may not interrupt the running thread until it finishes.

The Thread class uses default priority (5), which might allow one thread to complete before the other gets CPU time.


Is This Behavior Guaranteed?
      No! If you run the program multiple times, you might see different outputs where Thread-0 and Thread-1 interleave. The execution order depends on the JVM and OS.

When running TestNG tests in parallel mode, multiple test methods or classes execute concurrently using separate threads. The TestNG XML configuration defines the parallel execution mode (methods, classes, tests, or suites).


Step-by-Step Execution
1️⃣ TestNG starts execution and creates multiple threads (as per thread-count).
2️⃣ Each test method is assigned to a separate thread for parallel execution.
3️⃣ Threads execute methods independently, meaning TestClassA.test1 and TestClassB.test1 can run at the same time.
4️⃣ Once a thread completes one test method, it moves to the next available test method.
5️⃣ Test execution completes when all threads finish executing their assigned test methods.





Pom-ThreadLocal:
---------------

What is ThreadLocal in Java?
ThreadLocal<T> is a Java class that provides thread-local variables. These variables are isolated per thread, meaning each thread has its own copy, preventing conflicts when multiple threads access shared data(pages).



private- a variable which is accessible only within that class
   static-one instance will be shared among all the classes
      final-variable once initialized cannot be changed.


Steps: 1. private static final ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver> rd = new ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver>();

 private:
   It can be accessed only within the class
 static final:
    static+final = constant
 ThreadLocal:
   It is a class that provides thread-local variable

2. Use setter and getter methods
     Sets the current thread's copy of this thread-local variable

      public void setDriver(RemoteWebDriver driver) {
	rd.set(driver);

}
 Returns the value in the current thread's copy of this thread-local variable   
public RemoteWebDriver getDriver() {
	return rd.get();
}

@BeforeMethod
public void precondition(){
  setDriver();
  then replace driver variable into getDriver()
  getDriver().manage.window.max();
}





For TestNG _POM : - with driver as static -> sequential execution is possible
 - To have sequential and parallel execution declare Parameterized Constructor in each pages

For Cucumber_POM: 
- Constructor should not be defined 
- With driver as static 
-> sequential execution is possible






POM with Excel Integration:
---------------------------
Create data folder and have the excelsheets inside Login 
Create a package called utils and have the ReadExcel java class inside
Create sendData() and annotate with DataProvider and call the readExcel() and return
Replace all the hardcoded data with input arguments in the required pages
In the testClasses, use dataProvider attribute to receive the data and pass input arguments in the test method.
Create setValues() in each testclass to mention the fileName and annotate with @BeforeTest

How to Parameterize the data?
	  1)Create a new package(utils) and copy the ReadExel class from the previous project or package 
	  and paste it here
	  2)Create a data folder and create excel sheets
	  3)Declare the filedata globally in baseclass
	  4)Create a method for @DataProvider and call the ReadExel class
	  5)Integrate @Test with dataProvider attribute
	  6)Pass the inputs as arguments in the testcase method level and replace the hardcoded values
	  7)In the testcase create a method to mention the ExcelFileName and annotate with @BeforeTest

Basic Report: 

ExtentReports:
-Extenthtmlreporter--> used to create physical HTML report
-ExtentReports-----> to capture the automation data and attach to physical file
-ExtentTest---> To create TC in report and capture TC status
-MediaEntityBuilder----> To attach Screenshot to report

Steps to Generate Extent Report

Step 1: Set Physical Report Path

Example Path: Right-click the project → New → Folder → Name it as "reports".

ExtentHtmlReporter htmlReporter = new ExtentHtmlReporter("./reports/result.html");  

// To keep the history 
htmlReporter.setAppendExisting(true); 
 


Step 2: Create ExtentReports Object

ExtentReports extent = new ExtentReports(); 
 
Step 3: Attach Reporter to ExtentReports

extent.attachReporter(htmlReporter);  

Step 4: Create a Test & Assign Details

ExtentTest test1 = extent.createTest("CreateLead", "Create Lead with mandatory info");  
test1.assignCategory("Sanity");  
test1.assignAuthor("Bhuvanesh");  



Step 5: Add Test Logs (Pass/Fail Status)

test1.pass("Enter username");  
test1.pass("Enter password");  
test1.fail("Click Login button");  

Step 6: Flush the Report (Mandatory)

extent.flush();  
---------------------------------------------------------
create a unique name for report:

using LocalDateTime and DateTimeFormatter java class.

try-catch-finally blocks: 

in Java, the try-catch-finally construct is a fundamental mechanism for handling exceptions—unexpected events that disrupt the normal flow of a program. It comprises three primary blocks:​

1)try Block:

Contains code that might throw an exception.​

If an exception occurs within this block, the subsequent catch block(s) are examined to find a matching exception type.​

2)catch Block:

Follows the try block and handles specific exceptions thrown within the try block.​

Multiple catch blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions.​

Each catch block specifies the exception type it can handle.​

3)finally Block:

An optional block that follows the try or catch blocks.​

Contains code that is always executed after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught.​

Typically used for cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing resource
